# OAG Entity Alignment Task

## Prerequisites

- Linux
- Python 3
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA cuDNN

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zfjsail/OAG-entity-alignment.git
cd OAG-entity-alignment
```

Please install dependencies by

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from [BaiduPan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1n9kq3d-mJ0y1k7K4Bei-9g) (with password 445n) or [Aliyun](https://open-data-set.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oag-benchmark/entity-matching/el_data.zip). Unzip the file and put the _data_ directory into project directory.

## How to run
```bash
cd $project_path
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='?'  # specify which GPU(s) to be used
python processing.py  # all pre-processing process


python train_rnn_match.py --n-try 5 --entity-type author  # RNN-based matching model for author alignment
```

If you want to know about all supported baselines, see ```run.sh``` for details.
For entity types, we support three types of entities (*affliation*, *venue*, and *author*) for entity alignment.
For matching models, we support *RNN-based*, *CNN-based*, and *heterogeneous graph attention network (HGAT) based* models.
